**Macine Learning**:
- [Network Intrusion Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kamelelsehly/network-intrusion-detection): A project to provide a solution for a network intrusion detection problem, as a classification problem I used XGBoost model and since it's necessary to keep on detecting every possible intrusion, so I changed the threshold of rounding probabilities to catch every suspected intrusion achieving much better F1-score as an evaluation metric.
  - Dataset Used: [University of Newbrunswick DDoS2019 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html) | [Kaggle Data link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/elg7186-assignment-1-is-this-an-intrusion/data)
  - Tools: Sklearn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas
  
- [IOT Botnet Attack Detection](https://github.com/kamel-elsehly/Kafka-Streams---Intrusion-detection): A network Intrusion Detection problem in which I will perform binary class classification and predict whether there is an attack or not, and an IOT Botnet Attack Detection problem in which I will perform multiclass classification and predict is the case is normal or a specific type of attack.
For each one of these problems, I will implement two predictive modeling solutions: one static solution and another solution that adapts through time.
  - Dataset Used: IOT Botnet Attack detection dataset
  - Tools: Kafka-python, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas
- [Vodafone Spectrum Utilization Analysis](https://github.com/kamel-elsehly/Vodafone-Spectrum-Utilization-Optimization) : uOttawa Graduation project, mentored by Vodafone, this project is to optimize the utilization of spectrum by analyzing the SPEECH and DATA traffic, I Applied clustering to most correlated traffic then an LSTM model to analyze the behavior of the cells and predict the needed spectrum for future.  
  - Dataset Used: Cells traffic by Vodafone 
  - Tools: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, keras, MinMaxScaler, seaborn, nltk, tensorflow


**Computer Vision**:
- [Face Recognition](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O1Ne1-X7ho2OJc0ZJjMVPJX3_Ym1V_-r) | [github link](https://github.com/kamel-elsehly/Face_Recognition-): a simple project to train a face_recognition model on some persons giving some photos from different perspective then, it simulates how a security face recognition system works.
  - Dataset Used: collected photos from google of different public figures
  - Tools: Face_recognition, cv2, os 
- [Emotion Detection](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xWS9JW0eLXX9OFYdKpnCSjI7JG3f0GGr?usp=sharing) | [github link](https://github.com/kamel-elsehly/Emotion-Detection): Lite Application for live Emotion Detection using simple deep CNN *facebook deepface* library with other options like estimating Gender, Age and Race
  - Dataset Used: [Labled Faces in the Wild (LFW)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
  - Tools: deepface, cv2, numpy
- [Arabic Documents OCR](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WhX7j4Hudv9TICfNobmsbpGrw7ei59nR#scrollTo=Uwatr23mD2zH) | [github link](https://github.com/kamel-elsehly/Arabic-Documents-OCR)
  - Dataset Used: Tested on Random Arabic Documents from Google
  - Tools: easyOCR, python-bidi, PIL
